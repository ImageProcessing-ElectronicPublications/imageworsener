Unreleased changes
 - Support for writing BMP files with RLE4 compression.
 - Support for writing BMP files with RLE8 compression.

Version 0.9.8 - 18 Feb 2012
 - Support for building using GNU autotools.
 - Support for two types of custom grayscale formulas.
 - Added -gsf as an alias of -grayscaleformula, and made it unnecessary to
   specify "-grayscale" if you set the grayscale formula.
 - Support reading CMYK/YCCK JPEG images.

Version 0.9.7 - 30 Dec 2011
 - Support for custom memory allocation functions.
 - Renamed -pngcmprlevel option to -zipcmprlevel, and made it apply whenever
   zip/deflate compression is used.
 - Added Zip compression support for MIFF images, and made it the default.
 - Added "-compress" option.
 - Added support for transparent virtual pixels ("-edge t").
 - Added "-translate s" option, so you can specify the translation amount in
   source pixels instead of target pixels.
 - Enabled transparency support for WebP images.
 - Made the "edge policy" setting be per-dimension.
 - Removed the -filteralpha feature.
 - Stopped disallowing the "s" edge policy when -translate or -offset is used.
 - Changed the default downscaling filter to catrom.
 - Changed the box filter to have more predictable behavior.

Version 0.9.6 - 1 Dec 2011
 - Added -translate option, to fine-tune the position of the image.
 - Added "-blur x" option, to make it easy to do simple interpolation.
 - Support -blur when using the "mix" filter.
 - Added a way to request a specific density label.
 - Added an option to write JPEG files using arithmetic coding.
 - Don't clamp alpha samples before using them to apply a background color.
 - Added -noincludescreen option, for more control over how GIF images are
   handled.
 - Added -page option, to read arbitrary images from GIF files.
 - Changed the default bit depth to always be 8, instead of having it depend
   on the depth of the input file.

Version 0.9.5 - 8 Oct 2011
 - Use a binary search to find the nearest available color. Improves speed
   significantly in many cases.
 - Random dithering now uses a private pseudorandom number generator.
 - Changed the default PNG compression level to 9.
 - Updated the format of grayscale MIFF files to be compatible with the
   current version of ImageMagick.
 - Added -encoding option, to set the character encoding for text output.
 - Allow -cs to set the output colorspace even when IW doesn't think it's a
   good idea.
 - No longer attempting to make the output colorspace be the same as the
   input colorspace.

Version 0.9.4 - 9 Aug 2011
 - Added -density option, to give some control over how the density of the
   target image is calculated.
 - Added -nowarn and -noinfo options.
 - Support for reading GIF files.

Version 0.9.3 - 30 May 2011
 - Support for rational numbers like "1/3" in the command line.
 - Basic support for Google's WebP file format.
 - Partial support for ImageMagick's MIFF file format.
 - Support for image sizes that are relative to the original image size.
 - Moved strings to string tables.

Version 0.9.2 - 7 Apr 2011
 - Made the library use only UTF-8 for character encoding.
 - Improved resampling speed.
 - Read the background color metadata from PNG files, and use it as the
   background color in certain circumstances.
 - Detect input file formats based on the contents of the file, instead of the
   file name.
 - Added "sinc" filter.
 - Support for writing uncompressed TIFF files.
 - Replaced "-nobinarytrn" option with "-noopt".
 - Added a "halftone" ordered dither.
 - Support for reduced input bitdepths; respect PNG sBIT chunks.
 - The image format modules now use abstracted I/O.
 - Support for writing BMP files.
 - Added option to set the PNG compression level.
 - Improved speed of colorspace conversion.

Version 0.9.1 - 22 Feb 2011
 - Added a crop feature.
 - Support for optimizing to an image with binary transparency.
 - Added "-interlace" option.
 - Added "-jpegsampling" option.
 - Retain pixel density information if the image isn't being resized.
 - Support for optimizing to a 4- or 16-color grayscale image.

Version 0.9.0 - 6 Feb 2011
 - Initial public release.
