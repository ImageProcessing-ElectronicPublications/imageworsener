Acknowledgments
---------------

Some of the inspiration for this project came from these web pages:
  "Gamma error in picture scaling"
    http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/gamma.html
  "How to make a resampler that doesn't suck"
    http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=86

Information about resampling functions and other algorithms was gathered from
many sources, but ImageMagick's page on resizing was particularly helpful:
  http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/

Alternatives
------------

There are many applications and libraries that do image processing, but in the
free software world, the leader is ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/).

Building
--------

Dependencies:
  libpng
  zlib
  libjpeg

Sorry; I don't have any detailed build instructions. Under Windows, use Visual
Studio 2008 or newer. In a Linux/Unix environment, try typing "make". It
should build an executable file named "imagew" or "imagew.exe".

Philosophy
----------

IW tries to be as accurate as possible. It never trades accuracy for speed.
Really, it goes too far, as nearly everyone would rather have a program that
works twice as fast and is imperceptibly less accurate. But there are lots
of utilities that are optimized for speed, and there would be no reason for
IW to exist if it worked the same as everything else.

I don't intend to add millions of options to IW. I only want options that
serve some purpose. It is nearly feature complete as it is.

I've taken a lot of care to make sure the resizing algorithms are implemented
correctly. I won't add an algorithm until I'm sure that I understand it. This
isn't so easy. There's a lot of confusing and contradictory information out
there.

IW does not accept a sequence of image processing commands. Instead, tries to
create the best image it can given the options you pass to it. For example, if
you tell it to dither an image and resize it, it knows that it should resize
the image first, then dither it, instead of doing it in the opposite order.

In general, you don't have to tell it what color format to use. If you resize
a bilevel image, you'll automatically get high quality grayscale image, not a
low quality bilevel image. 

IW usually does not care about how the input image is stored. A 1-bit image is
treated the same as an 8-bit representation of the same image. There are,
however, a few minor exceptions (which can be disabled):
 - It will try to keep the image in the same colorspace.
 - It will try to keep 16-bit images at 16-bits.
 - The -condgrayscale option will keep grayscale images grayscale.

ImageWorsener architecture
--------------------------

IW has three components: The core library, the auxiliary library, and the
command-line utility.

The core library does the image processing, but does not do any file I/O. It
knows almost nothing about PNG and JPEG file formats. It has access to the
internal data structures defined in imagew-internals.h. It does not make any
direct calls to the auxiliary library.

The auxiliary library consists of the file I/O code that is specific to file
formats like PNG and JPEG. It does not use the internal data structures from
imagew-internals.h.

The public interface is completely defined in the imagew.h file. It includes
declarations for both the core and auxiliary library.

The command-line utility is implemented in imagew-cmd.c. It uses both the core
library and the auxiliary library.

The core and auxiliary libraries are separated in order to break dependencies.
For example, if your application supports only PNG files, you can probably
(given how most linkers work) build it without linking to libjpeg.

Double-precision floating point?
--------------------------------

IW can be compiled to use any available floating point type for its internal
representation of samples. (Unfortunately, it's impractical to make this a
run-time option.) Its default is currently set to be "double", which is
usually an 8-byte floating-point number. This may seem like overkill, and I
admit, it probably is, at least for 8-bit target images.

For 8-bit target images, switching to 4-byte floating point might affect only
one pixel in every 50,000. For 16-bit target images, it's more like one pixel
in every few hundred.

Using double precision shouldn't have too much effect on performance, at least
if it's compiled as a 64-bit application. But it will use a lot more memory.

4-byte floating-point number give you about 7 significant digits, which in
extreme cases may not be quite enough. Particularly for 16-bit target images,
when working in a linear colorspace, bright samples are much, much brighter
than the dimmest pixels. If IW has to add a huge number of dim pixels together
with just a few bright pixels, 7 significant digits might not be enough to
do the kind of accurate calculations it strives for.

Unicode
-------

Text files like this one notwithstanding, I've decided that ASCII must die. As
simple as the text output from the command line utility is, it will use try to
use Unicode quotation marks, arrows, etc., if possible. In a Unix environment,
this can probably be turned off at runtime with environment variables, such as
by setting "LANG=C". Whether the Windows version uses Unicode is determined at
compile time.

Colorspaces
-----------

Unless it has reason to believe otherwise, IW assumes that images use the sRGB
colorspace. This is the colorspace that standard computer monitors use, and
it's a reasonable assumption that most computer image files (whether by
accident or design) are intended to be directly displayable on computer
monitors.

IW does not support ICC color profiles. I'll consider adding support for them
someday, but I don't know how feasible that is.

TIFF Colorspaces
----------------

When writing TIFF files, IW uses the TransferFunction TIFF tag to label the
colorspace that the output image uses. I doubt that many TIFF viewers read
this tag, and actually, I don't know how to test whether I'm using it
correctly. You can disable the TransferFunction tag by using the "-nocslabel"
option.

TIFF output support
-------------------

IW mainly sticks to the "baseline" TIFF v6 specification, but it will write
images with a sample depth of 16 bits, which is not part of the baseline spec.
It writes transparent images using unassociated alpha, which is probably less
common in TIFF files than associated alpha, and may not be supported as well
by TIFF viewers.

Nonsquare pixels
----------------

If you use one of the scaling options that doesn't change the aspect ratio, IW
always writes an image with square pixels. Example: Suppose the input image is
a fax with an X density of 204dpi and a Y density of 96dpi. It will scale the
Y dimension by a factor that's 204/96 times larger than the X dimension's
scaling factor.

"Color" of transparent pixels
-----------------------------

In image formats that use unassociated alpha values to indicate transparency,
pixels that are fully transparent still have "colors", but those colors are
irrelevant. IW will not attempt to retain such colors, and will make fully-
transparent pixels black in most cases. An exception is if the output image
uses color-keyed transparency, in which case it uses a different strategy.

PNG sBIT chunks
---------------

If a PNG image contains the rarely-used sBIT chunk, IW will ignore any bits
that the sBIT chunk indicates are not significant.

Suppose you have an 8-bit grayscale image with an sBIT chunk that says 3 bits
are significant. If the app that wrote the file was not defective, there will
probably be only 8 colors in the image. The image might contain these colors:

00000000 =   0/255 = 0.00000000
00100100 =  36/255 = 0.14117647
01001001 =  73/255 = 0.28627450
01101101 = 109/255 = 0.42745098
10010010 = 146/255 = 0.57254901
10110110 = 182/255 = 0.71372549
11011011 = 219/255 = 0.85882352
11111111 = 255/255 = 1.00000000

IW, though, will see only the significant bits, and will interpret the image
like this:

000 = 0/7 = 0.00000000
001 = 1/7 = 0.14285714
010 = 2/7 = 0.28571428
011 = 3/7 = 0.42857142
100 = 4/7 = 0.57142857
101 = 5/7 = 0.71428571
110 = 6/7 = 0.85714285
111 = 7/7 = 1.00000000

So, the interpretation is slightly different (e.g. 0.14285714 instead of
0.14117647).

Ordered dithering + transparency
--------------------------------

Ordered (or halftone) dithering with IW can produce poor results when used
with images that have partial transparency. If you ordered-dither both the
colors and the alpha channel, you can have a situation where all the (say)
darker pixels get made transparent, leaving only the lighter pixels visible,
and making the image much lighter than it should be. This happens because the
same dither pattern is used for two purposes (color threshholding and
transparency threshholding).

To do
-----

Features I'm considering adding:

- More options for aligning the input pixels with the output pixels.

- More options for virtual pixels (transparency, at least).

- Support maintaining or adjusting the pixel density even when the image is
  resized.

- Options to maintain PNG background colors.

- Internationalization. Maybe use UTF-8 internally. I'm not sure what can be
  done about error messages that come from libpng or libjpeg.

Contributing
------------

I may accept code contributions, if they fit the spirit of the project. I will
probably not accept contributions on which you or someone else claims
copyright. At this stage, I want to retain the ability to change the licensing
terms unilaterally.

Of course, the license allows you to fork your own version of ImageWorsener if
you wish to.
